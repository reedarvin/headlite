1. Image microSD card with one of the following base images (I use the Raspberry Pi Imager):
	- Raspberry Pi 4b - rpi4b-openwrt-*****-rpi-4-squashfs-factory.img.gz
	- Raspberry Pi Zero W2 - rpizw2-openwrt-*****-rpi-3-squashfs-factory.img.gz

2. Install the microSD card and power on the device

3. Connect to the headlite SSID (wait a few mins):
	- SSH to device at root@192.168.1.1 (i.e. ssh root@192.168.1.1)
	- Add a secondary IP address in the 192.168.1.x range (if necessary)

4. Connect to OpenWrt/LuCI:
	- Browse to http://192.168.1.1 or http://headlite.local / http://headlitemini.local
	- Firefox seems to work better than Chrome for this
